This project is based on the fitness data shared on kaggle,it collected in a survey format with some multiple answers questions.
The project mainly showcase how to deal with survey type of dataset,especially when there are many variables with multiple entry,
due to the small sample size as well as the limited variables collected, the tasks done with such dataset is limited,reader will expect
to follow alone the code I created to go through data cleaning process and some data visulization later on.

To run the code,readers simply download open up the R file called "fa1.R" then read in dataset labeled "fa.CSV". The purpose of each chunk of code
is noted as markdown before the code.
